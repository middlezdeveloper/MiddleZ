# Claude Code MVP Prompt: AI vs AI+HCD Demo Prototype

## Project Brief
Create a **minimal viable prototype** of an interactive demo that showcases the difference between raw AI output and AI enhanced with Human-Centered Design. This is a proof-of-concept to test user experience and visual impact before investing in full API integration.

## MVP Scope
**Focus**: Visual design, user flow, and impact demonstration
**Skip**: Real AI integration, backend, complex features
**Goal**: Test if the concept resonates and looks impressive

## Technical Requirements

### Tech Stack (Minimal)
- **Single HTML file** with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- **No build process** required
- **No external APIs** - all dummy data
- **Responsive design** using CSS Grid/Flexbox
- **Smooth animations** using CSS transitions and keyframes

### Core Features (MVP)
1. **Hero section** with compelling copy
2. **Input form** with predefined challenge examples
3. **Split-screen comparison** with dummy responses
4. **Typing animation** for dramatic reveal
5. **Visual transformation** from cold ‚Üí warm design
6. **Mobile responsive** layout

## User Flow (Simplified)

### Step 1: Landing
```
Hero: "Same AI. Different Human."
Subtitle: "See how Human-Centered Design transforms AI from generic to genius"
CTA: "Try the Demo"
```

### Step 2: Challenge Selection
Instead of free input, provide **3 predefined challenges**:
1. "Our customers aren't using our new dashboard feature"
2. "Employee engagement scores are declining"  
3. "Marketing campaigns aren't converting"

### Step 3: Loading Animation
- 3-second fake "generating" animation
- Progress indicators for both sides
- Build anticipation

### Step 4: Split Reveal
- Left side (Raw AI): Cold, technical response
- Right side (HCD AI): Warm, human-centered response
- Animated typing effect reveals text
- Visual styling emphasizes the difference

### Step 5: Explanation Overlay
- Click to reveal "How we did it"
- Show prompting methodology difference
- Highlight key HCD principles applied

## Dummy Data Structure

### Challenge 1: Dashboard Feature
```javascript
const responses = {
  rawAI: `Dashboard Feature Adoption Strategy:
  
‚Ä¢ Improve onboarding flow with tutorials
‚Ä¢ Add tooltips and help guides  
‚Ä¢ Launch email campaigns
‚Ä¢ Track usage metrics
‚Ä¢ A/B test layouts
‚Ä¢ Provide support training
‚Ä¢ Create documentation
‚Ä¢ Collect user feedback`,

  hcdAI: `üéØ The Human Truth: Change Disrupts Comfort

Your customers aren't avoiding your dashboard because it's bad‚Äîthey're avoiding change because it feels risky.

üí° The Insight: 
Features don't fail because they're broken.
They fail because they disrupt comfort.

üõ†Ô∏è The Human-Centered Approach:

**Phase 1: Shadow & Understand**
‚Üí Watch 5 users navigate current system
‚Üí Map emotional journey (frustration ‚Üí success)
‚Üí Find their "comfort anchors"

**Phase 2: Bridge, Don't Replace**  
‚Üí Design familiar transition moments
‚Üí Show immediate personal value
‚Üí Celebrate small wins loudly

**Result: 67% adoption vs industry 23%**`
}
```

### Challenge 2: Employee Engagement
```javascript
rawAI: `Employee Engagement Improvement Plan:
‚Ä¢ Conduct engagement surveys
‚Ä¢ Implement recognition programs  
‚Ä¢ Improve communication channels
‚Ä¢ Offer professional development
‚Ä¢ Review compensation packages
‚Ä¢ Enhance work-life balance
‚Ä¢ Team building activities
‚Ä¢ Exit interview analysis`,

hcdAI: `üéØ The Human Reality: People Don't Leave Jobs, They Leave Feelings

Low engagement isn't about perks or pay‚Äîit's about purpose and psychological safety.

üí° The Emotional Truth:
‚Üí Disengagement = Disconnection from meaning
‚Üí People need to matter, not just perform
‚Üí Recognition hits different when it's personal

üõ†Ô∏è The Human-Centered Strategy:

**Week 1: Listen Like You Mean It**
‚Üí 1-on-1s focused on feelings, not tasks
‚Üí "What makes you excited to wake up?"
‚Üí Map the invisible emotional workplace

**Week 2: Micro-Moments of Mattering**
‚Üí Celebrate progress, not just outcomes
‚Üí Connect daily work to bigger purpose
‚Üí Make appreciation specific and timely

**Result: 43% engagement increase in 90 days**`
}
```

### Challenge 3: Marketing Conversion
```javascript
rawAI: `Marketing Campaign Optimization:
‚Ä¢ Analyze conversion funnel data
‚Ä¢ A/B test different messaging
‚Ä¢ Improve landing page design
‚Ä¢ Optimize ad targeting
‚Ä¢ Refine email sequences  
‚Ä¢ Test different CTAs
‚Ä¢ Analyze competitor strategies
‚Ä¢ Increase budget allocation`,

hcdAI: `üéØ The Human Challenge: Trust Takes Time

Your campaigns aren't converting because you're selling to strangers who don't trust strangers.

üí° The Connection Gap:
‚Üí Features tell, stories sell
‚Üí Logic makes them think, emotion makes them buy
‚Üí People buy from people they understand

üõ†Ô∏è The Human-Centered Campaign:

**Phase 1: Find Your Humans**
‚Üí Interview 10 happy customers about their journey
‚Üí Map the emotional transformation story
‚Üí Identify the "aha moment" trigger

**Phase 2: Speak Their Language**
‚Üí Lead with the feeling they want
‚Üí Use their words, not yours  
‚Üí Show the life change, not the feature list

**Result: 156% conversion increase**`
}
```

## Design Specifications

### Visual Contrast
**Raw AI Side:**
```css
/* Cold, clinical design */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1e293b 0%, #334155 100%);
color: #94a3b8;
font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;
border: 1px solid #475569;
border-radius: 4px; /* Sharp corners */
```

**HCD AI Side:**
```css
/* Warm, human design */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #7c3aed 0%, #f97316 100%);
color: #ffffff;
font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
