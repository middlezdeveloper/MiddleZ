# START HERE - Local Testing

## ‚ö° Test Locally Right Now (10 minutes)

Everything runs on your computer. No deployment needed yet.

---

## Step 1: Get a Free Test Database (3 minutes)

You need PostgreSQL. **Easiest option: Supabase** (100% free, no credit card)

### Option A: Supabase (Recommended)

1. Go to https://supabase.com
2. Click "Start your project"
3. Sign in with GitHub
4. Click "New Project"
5. Fill in:
   - **Name:** `middlez-test`
   - **Database Password:** Click "Generate password" (save it somewhere)
   - **Region:** Choose closest to you
6. Click "Create new project"
7. **Wait 2 minutes** while it provisions

**Get your connection string:**
1. Go to Project Settings (gear icon) ‚Üí Database
2. Scroll to "Connection string" section
3. Select **"Connection pooling"** tab (important!)
4. Copy the URI (starts with `postgresql://`)
5. Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` in the string with your actual password

**Your connection string looks like:**
```
postgresql://postgres.abcdefgh:YourPassword@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
```

### Option B: Local PostgreSQL (If you already have it)

If you have PostgreSQL installed locally:
```
postgresql://localhost:5432/middlez_survey
```

---

## Step 2: Configure Environment (1 minute)

```bash
# Navigate to the survey app
cd /Users/danielmiddlemiss/Documents/Vibecode/MiddleZ/survey-app

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env
```

**Edit `.env` file:**

Open `.env` in your text editor and add:

```env
# Your Supabase connection string from Step 1
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres.abcdefgh:YourPassword@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres"

# Local testing URLs
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="any-random-string-for-local-testing-123456"

# Email - Leave empty for now (we'll test admin later)
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST=""
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=""
EMAIL_SERVER_USER=""
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=""
EMAIL_FROM="noreply@middlez.com"
```

**Save the file!**

---

## Step 3: Install & Setup (2 minutes)

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Generate Prisma client
npm run db:generate

# Create database tables
npm run db:push

# Load sample data (2 projects + 1 sample response)
npm run db:seed
```

**Expected output:**
```
Environment variables loaded from .env
Prisma schema loaded from prisma/schema.prisma

üå± Seeding database...
‚úÖ Created sample projects: {
  project1: 'Digital Transformation Strategy',
  project2: 'Innovation Workshop Series'
}
‚úÖ Created sample response from: Jane Smith
üéâ Seeding completed successfully!
```

**If you see errors:**
- Check `DATABASE_URL` is correct in `.env`
- Make sure you replaced `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with actual password
- Verify Supabase project is running (green indicator)

---

## Step 4: Start Local Server (30 seconds)

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Expected output:**
```
‚ñ≤ Next.js 15.5.5
- Local:        http://localhost:3000
- Environments: .env

‚úì Ready in 2.3s
```

**Server is now running!** Keep this terminal open.

# Open new terminal (keep dev server running)
npx prisma studio
```

**Fill it out again with different data:**
- Name: "Test User 2"
- Email: "test2@example.com"
- Different star ratings
- Different NPS (try 7 - should say "Passive")
- Complete all steps and submit

**Check database again:**
- Should now see **3 responses** total

- Each has unique `id`

**‚úÖ SUCCESS! This proves multiple people can respond to same project!**

---

### Test 5: Privacy Policy

Open: **http://localhost:3000/privacy**

- [x] Can submit multiple responses to same project

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Database connection error"

**Check:**
1. Is your Supabase project running? (green status in dashboard)
2. Did you replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` in connection string?
3. Did you use "Connection pooling" string (not "Session")?

**Fix:**
```bash
# Test connection
npx prisma db push
```

Should say: "Your database is now in sync with your Prisma schema."

---

### "npm run dev" won't start

```bash
# Clear and reinstall
rm -rf .next node_modules
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

### Survey won't submit

**Open browser console (F12) and look for errors**

Common issues:
- Forgot to check privacy consent checkboxes (step 1)
- If testimonial = yes, must check release agreement box
- Network error (check database connection)

---

### "npm command not found"

You need Node.js installed:
1. Go to https://nodejs.org
2. Download LTS version
3. Install
4. Restart terminal
5. Try again

## üöÄ After Local Testing Succeeds

**If all tests pass:**

1. **Run production build test:**
