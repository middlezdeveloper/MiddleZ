# Middle Z Survey System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a complete, production-ready survey system for Middle Z consulting engagement assessment. The system is built as a standalone Next.js application designed to be deployed at `survey.middlez.com`.

## ✅ What Has Been Built

### 🎯 **KEY FEATURE: Many Responses Per Project**

The system is **specifically designed** for the use case where:
- You create ONE project per engagement
- You share ONE link with MULTIPLE stakeholders at the client organization
- Each stakeholder completes the survey independently
- All responses are aggregated in the analytics dashboard

**Example:** "Digital Strategy - Acme Corp" project receives responses from CEO, CTO, and 5 team members (7 total), all analyzed together with combined NPS, Kirkpatrick averages, and insights.

See `MULTI_RESPONSE_GUIDE.md` for complete details on this workflow.

### 1. **Database Architecture** (Prisma + PostgreSQL)

Three core tables:
- `survey_projects` - Project/engagement information
- `survey_responses` - Complete survey data with all Kirkpatrick levels
- `testimonial_usage_log` - Track where testimonials are used
- Plus NextAuth tables for authentication

**Schema includes:**
- All 4 Kirkpatrick levels (Reaction, Learning, Behaviour, Results)
- Net Promoter Score (0-10 scale)
- Testimonial consent with granular attribution preferences
- Privacy consent tracking (IP, timestamp)
- Anonymous submission support

### 2. **9-Step Survey Flow** (React Hook Form + Zod)

**Step 1: Welcome & Privacy**
- Project information display
- Optional respondent details (name, email, organization)
- Anonymous submission checkbox
- Privacy policy acceptance (required)
- Consent to feedback (required)

**Step 2: Level 1 - Reaction**

**Response Management:**

- Filter by NPS category
- Sort by date, satisfaction, etc.
- See testimonial consent status

### 4b. **Project Management UI** (`/admin/projects`) 🆕

**Easy Survey Link Creation:**
